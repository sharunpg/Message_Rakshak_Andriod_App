# Message_Rakshak_Andriod_App
# 📩 MessageRakshak – Smart SMS Scam Detection Android App

This project develops an Android-based SMS scam detection system that verifies suspicious messages and classifies them as **SAFE, PROMOTIONAL, or DANGEROUS**. The system accepts user-entered messages, processes them through a structured detection pipeline, and analyzes risky keywords and suspicious links using a **rule-based scoring engine combined with Google Safe Browsing API**.

The goal of the system is to **reduce the risk of phishing attacks, scam messages, and malicious links by providing a lightweight, explainable, and user-friendly mobile security assistant.**

---

# How the System Works (Step-by-Step)

The application follows a **hybrid detection pipeline**. Each module processes the message sequentially before producing the final classification result.

---

## Step 1: User Authentication

The process begins when the user logs into the application through the **local login/signup interface**.

The authentication system uses:

- SharedPreferences for credential storage
- Login verification
- Signup support
- Logout functionality

This ensures a personalized and secure user experience.

---

## Step 2: Message Input

The user enters a suspicious SMS or message inside the detection interface.

Example:

“Your account will be blocked immediately. Click here to verify now:
http://fakebank-alert.xyz”

The system then forwards the message to the detection engine.

---

## Step 3: Keyword-Based Risk Detection

The SmartDetector module scans the message using predefined scam-related keyword rules.

Detected risk indicators include:

- OTP requests
- Urgent action warnings
- Fake banking alerts
- Suspicious verification links
- Threat-based language

Example keywords:

- urgent
- verify now
- click here
- OTP
- account blocked
- limited time offer

Each keyword contributes to a **risk score** used during classification.

---

## Step 4: Suspicious Link Detection

If a URL is detected inside the message, the system validates it using:

Google Safe Browsing API

The API checks whether the URL belongs to:

- Malware sources
- Phishing domains
- Unsafe redirect links
- Harmful websites

If detected unsafe, the message classification becomes **DANGEROUS**.

---

## Step 5: Classification Engine

The decision engine combines:

- Keyword risk score
- URL safety status
- Message pattern indicators

Based on predefined thresholds, the system assigns the final label:

### 1️⃣ SAFE

The message does not contain suspicious keywords or harmful links.

Example:

“Your electricity bill payment was successful.”

---

### 2️⃣ PROMOTIONAL

The message contains marketing or advertisement content.

Example:

“Flat 50% discount on shoes today!”

---

### 3️⃣ DANGEROUS

The message contains phishing indicators or malicious links.

Example:

“Click here to reset your bank password immediately.”

---

## Step 6: Message History Storage

The system stores analyzed messages locally using **SharedPreferences**.

Stored information includes:

- Message content
- Classification result
- Timestamp

This allows users to revisit previously checked messages.

---

## Step 7: Dashboard Analytics

The dashboard module provides summary statistics such as:

- Number of Safe messages
- Number of Promotional messages
- Number of Dangerous messages

This helps users monitor their message safety trends over time.

---

# Final Workflow Summary

The complete pipeline is:

User Login
→ Enter Message
→ Keyword Pattern Detection
→ URL Extraction
→ Google Safe Browsing API Check
→ Risk Score Calculation
→ Classification Engine
→ Save History
→ Dashboard Visualization
→ Final Output


This architecture ensures **fast, lightweight, and explainable SMS scam detection on mobile devices.**
